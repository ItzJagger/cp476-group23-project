This project is being designed to create a space where users can access games all from a single area. They must first log in and then once there they have access to two main pages
1. The first page being the library page. This is where users can interact with the games they have purchased in an organized list. They can click on their games to open a page fully tailored to that specific game. From this page they are able to review the game based on their expeirence and publish the review. 

2. The second page being the store page. Users can access the store to browse and search for games. They will be able to add games to their library. Games will be displayed throughout this page and the user is able to pick and choose which game they might look at and potentially purchase. Just like the Library section, users can click on a game and a tailored tab will pop up for the game where they can look at the details as they could in the library, the just wont be able to leave a review.
